This project  analyzes a dataset of traffic stops in Rhode Island that was collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project and analyze the police behavior from the following perspectives:
* Analyze impact of gender on police behavior<br>
Do the genders commit different violations? Does the gender of a driver have an impact on police behavior during a traffic stop? We will explore those questions while practicing filtering, grouping, method chaining, Boolean math, string methods, and more!
* Analyze trends<br>
Are you more likely to get arrested at a certain time of day? Are drug-related stops on the rise? We will answer these and other questions by analyzing the dataset visually, since plots can help us to understand trends in a way that examining the raw data cannot.
* Analyzing the effect of weather on policing<br>
We will use a second dataset to explore the impact of weather conditions on police behavior during traffic stops. We will practice merging and reshaping datasets, assessing whether a data source is trustworthy, working with categorical data, and other advanced skills.
This is a project from datacamp course.
